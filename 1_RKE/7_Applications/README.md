# Applications
* The Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take the accessibility of the vehicle  to a higher level. With PKE, car owners only have  to pull the door handle when the key fob is on. No need to look for pockets or purses, no need to press a button. 
 * Two-way communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or a similar trigger is activated), the vehicle's base unit  emits a short-range low-frequency signal looking for a nearby key fob transponder. If present, the  fob detects the signal, responds with a UHF (Ultra High Frequency) signal, and sends a code  authenticated by the  encryption firmware of the base unit.
